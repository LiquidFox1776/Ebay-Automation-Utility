# Ebay Automation Utility

## Description
A Chrome extension that fills out some of the form fields on the Ebay selling page.

This is by no means a finished project and was last used in 2017. I am uploading this code in the hopes that someone may get some use out of it.
The extension allows you to copy data from one or more websites(content owned by you or have the rights to copy and use) with the use of a context menu and attempts to fill out some of the form fields on Ebay's selling page.
The extension also has the ability to print text out on a label using a Dymo label printer with the Dymo framework & print server.
Note that there is some left over code from when Ebay's selling page had a different layout.

## Installation 
* In Chrome go to the extension settings
* Enable Developer Mode
* Load an unpacked extension and point it to the download directory for this project
